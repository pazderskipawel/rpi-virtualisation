# rpi-virtualisation

Create and manage virtual machines and containers on a Raspberry Pi (RPi 5)

## Overview

This repository documents and contains supporting material for running virtual machines on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) with an attached SSD. The goal is to have a reproducible, automated environment for provisioning and managing VMs and their networking using infrastructure-as-code tools.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB)
- Official Raspberry Pi NVMe/M.2 SSD expansion board (official SSD HAT) â€” e.g. NVMe M.2 drive (256 GB)

## Software stack

- Raspberry Pi OS (or a Debian-based distribution for arm64)
- Ansible, Docker

## Prerequisites

On a fresh Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) install, ensure you have:

- Sufficient disk space on the SSD
- A non-root user with sudo privileges
- A network connection (for package installs and optional remote management)

- If you're using the official Raspberry Pi SSD board, ensure the board and M.2 drive are properly seated and that any required firmware/kernel updates are applied. Some boards may need extra power or cooling under sustained load.

## Current architecture
GITHUB ACTIONS:
  - CICD:
    - installs ansible on rpi if not installed
RPI:
  - ANSIBLE:
    - praperes host for running VMs and docker containers
  - DOCKER:
    - compose file for klipper 
## Planned architecture
Raspberry PI
- ansible playbooks (ansible running locally)
  - configuring host for qemu/KVM virtualisation
  - managing Home Assistant OS VM
- docker 
  - klipper container for managing my 3d printer
  - some kind of ui for managing VMs and containers (Ansible Semaphore probably)
Repository
- Actions for pulling current repo to raspberry pi and launching everyting new
