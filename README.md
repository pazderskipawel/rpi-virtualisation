# rpi-virtualisation

Create and manage virtual machines and containers on a Raspberry Pi (RPi 5)


## Overview

This repository documents and contains supporting material for running virtual machines on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB) with an attached SSD. The goal is to have a reproducible, automated environment for provisioning and managing VMs and their networking using infrastructure-as-code tools.

## Current Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB)
- Official Raspberry Pi NVMe/M.2 SSD expansion board (official SSD HAT) â€” e.g. NVMe M.2 drive (256 GB)

## Software stack

- Raspberry Pi OS (or a Debian-based distribution for arm64)
- Ansible, Docker
- GitHub Actions runner (optional, for running simple pipeline)

## Planned architecture
Github Projcet for this repo - [LINK](https://github.com/users/pazderskipawel/projects/1) 

## Current architecture
GITHUB ACTIONS:
  - CICD:
    - checks out code
    - runs playbook which runs docker and qemu
  - [![Deploy app to Pi](https://github.com/pazderskipawel/rpi-virtualisation/actions/workflows/deploy_to_pi.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/pazderskipawel/rpi-virtualisation/actions/workflows/deploy_to_pi.yml)
  
RPI:
  - ANSIBLE (managing raspberry itself):

    Roles tasks:
    - raspberry:
      - updates apt packages
    - qemu:
      - Prepares and starts qemu, libvrt
      - shared task to create new vm
      - shared task to create vm network
    - docker:
      - installs and runs docker and docker compose
    - nginx: 
      - runs docker container with network mode: host to controll networking
      - shared task to add new service config file to nginx
    - klipper (managing 3d printer form RPI):
      - playbook to run docker copose from file with services managing 3d-printer (klipper/mooraker/fliudd)
      - config file for nginx (applied using shared nginx task)
    - [cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/applications) (Web-based interface for managing servers):
      - UI app to manage server config, containers and vms
      - config file for nginx (applied using shared nginx task)
    - home assistant vm 
      - file with variables
      - playbook which downloads image and runs qemu tasks to create vm and network
      - file with network configuration for vm
    - playbook tu run all services
    - playbook to remove all services and its files
